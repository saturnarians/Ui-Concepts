                Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a
                website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily
                interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages,
                design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down
                menus, layouts, and designs for websites.
              </p>

              <p>
                Front-end devs use computer programming languages like
                JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading
                Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a
                unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure,
                CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced
                interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other
                programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.

                A front-end developer typically needs a bachelor's degree in web
                design, programming, computer science, or graphic design. Some
                individuals develop these skills through previous work,
                bootcamps, or projects to find employment without pursuing
                formal education.

                Back-end developers focus on the server side of websites. They
                use technical skills to perform the behind-the-scenes work that
                creates a website's structure and overall functionality,
                allowing a site's front end to exist. These professionals create
                a site's operations, databases, and application programming
                interface (API).
              </p>

              <p>
                The back end includes an application, server, and database.
                Computer users often do not see the elements of back-end
                development, which remain below the hood of a website.

            <article class="accordion-sub-text">
              <p>
                Back-end developers need advanced experience in server-side
                programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to build
                applications. Students can learn or brush up on specific
                computer programming languages by completing bootcamps. For
                example, see our page on the best Python bootcamps.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back-end devs use tools like SQL Server and Oracle to store,
                organize, and change data. Employers often require expertise
                with PHP frameworks, version control software, and debugging
                back-end systems and applications. Back-end devs collaborate
                with front-end developers, management, and business stakeholders
                to understand each project's goals.
