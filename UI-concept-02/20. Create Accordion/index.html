          <h2>Can I become a front end developer in 3 months?</h2>
          <p>
            Yeah, it's possible but most people need more time than 3 months to
            land a job. If you really want a job in 3 months then expect to
            learn for 8–12 hours a day on Team Treehouse Tech Degree or a coding
            bootcamp, I would say that would be your best bet.

          <h2>Can I get a coding job without degree?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, you can get a coding job without a degree. Since there is a
            high demand for tech professionals, employers are more willing to
            hire experienced professionals irrespective of their educational
            qualifications. Top tech companies like Google have hired tech staff
            without degrees
