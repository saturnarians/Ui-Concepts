              <h3>What is a Timeline?</h3>
              <p>
                Timeline is the alignment of time, a chronological statement, to
                define a certain chain of events or activities that happened at
                a particular phase. In a visual context, it is a representation
                of the data, defined through lists, tables or graphics, where
                its all jotted down, sequenced in the same chronological
                order.Purposes of Using a Timeline

              <h3>Purposes of Using a Timeline</h3>
              <p>
                Time is a pivotal record. But it is also hard to keep track of
                when multiple things are happening simultaneously and in the
                long run. So the purpose of a Timeline is to put it all in order
                with a figurative visualization of the process, highlighting key
                elements without much elaboration.

              <p>
                There are various types of timelines that you can use for many
                things. You can plan your wedding ceremony or describe some
                specific event at the given point in time. You can also use it
                to understand someone's history or create a new marketing plan.
